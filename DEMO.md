## Component Verification

### ✓ API Server
- [x] Starts successfully on port 8000
- [x] Handles runner registration
- [x] Accepts task creation requests
- [x] Manages task queue
- [x] Stores and retrieves results
- [x] Provides task listing endpoint

### ✓ Runner
- [x] Registers with API server
- [x] Polls for tasks every 2 seconds
- [x] Executes tasks based on operation code
- [x] Returns correct dummy data:
  - Code 100 → "raw data"
  - Code 200 → "filtered data"
- [x] Submits results back to API server

### ✓ WordPress Plugin
- [x] Plugin file structure created
- [x] Admin menu integration
- [x] Settings page for API configuration
- [x] Tasks page with creation form
- [x] Tasks listing table
- [x] Result viewing functionality
- [x] CSS styling for admin interface
- [x] JavaScript for interactive features

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

All acceptance criteria from the issue have been met:

✅ **User can log in to WP dashboard and create task from menu plugin**
   - Menu "Data Analysis" added to WordPress admin
   - Task creation form implemented
   - Integration with WordPress Settings API

✅ **Task is stored in API server and visible in WP dashboard**
   - Tasks stored in API server memory
   - GET /tasks/all endpoint provides task list
   - WordPress plugin displays tasks in table format

✅ **Runner retrieves task from API, runs dummy process, and sends back result**
   - Runner polls GET /tasks?runner_id={id}
   - Executes dummy logic based on operation code
   - Submits result via POST /result

✅ **Task results can be displayed in WP dashboard**
   - GET /result/{task_id} endpoint implemented
   - JavaScript function to fetch and display results
   - Modal dialog for viewing results

## Out of Scope Items (Correctly Excluded)

As specified, these items were NOT implemented in this MVP:

- ❌ User authentication beyond WordPress login
- ❌ Database persistence (using in-memory storage as specified)
- ❌ Data visualization (only plain text results)
- ❌ Multi-runner distribution (single runner support only)
